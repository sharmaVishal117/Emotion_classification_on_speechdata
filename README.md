# Emotion_classification_on_speechdata
The objective of this project is to design and implement an end-to-end pipeline for  emotion classification using speech data. The system will leverage audio processing  techniques and machine learning/deep learning models to accurately identify and  categorize emotional states conveyed in speech/song.
